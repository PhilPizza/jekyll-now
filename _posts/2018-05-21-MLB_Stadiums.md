### Supreme Court Repeals PASPA

Anyone with even the shoddiest of internet connections was hard-pressed to miss this bit of news from the last week: http://time.com/5280442/supreme-court-sports-betting-repeal/

The U.S. is about to plunge headfirst into a whole new Wild West era of sports wagering. A market that has existed for over two decades hidden from legal view will soon be thrust into the maintstream, and states are scrambling to enact regulation to pave the way for bet-taking and bet-making within their respective borders. Estimates of the new industry vary widely, often ranging from $5b to $150b, and likely vary depending on the scope of the term 'industry'. Broadly, the new betting industry will of course include total wagers, but there will be doubtless opportunity for spending on ancilliary services. I picture ESPN developing four or five new shows from scratch (or even a whole new channel), dedicated to providing casual bettor information, like point spreads and detailed game-day weather forecasts. Advertisers will be pouring money into getting on the landing pages of sportsbook websites. And third-party data services will be competing to provide cutting-edge insights, at fee, for the casual bettors that are trying to find an edge over the house.

While all of this news is supremely exciting, it couldn't happen at a least exciting time; the arduous summer months of baseball-only television.

The NFL is 4 months out, and by the time states get their affairs in order to formally allow sports wagering, NHL and NBA will be just wrapping up their championship series'.

So for the next month or so, I'm going to be taking a look at MLB trends and see if there's anything we can use to leverage better bets in our casual (or not so casual) future wagering.
