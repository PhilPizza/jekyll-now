Inspired by data science, grounded in engineering. 

I'm an adaptive professional and a "structural-engineer-turned-data-scientist" with seven years of experience as a structural engineer in New York State. I consider myself an articulate researcher driven by a passion to explore the tremendous power of data, and its applications in today's business landscape.
